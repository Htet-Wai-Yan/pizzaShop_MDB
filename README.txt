# Pizza Shop

This is the one of the bootstrap exercises except for using similar __Material Design Bootstrap__ Framework.

The purpose of this exercise is to explore MDB usability and try customizing MDB as it's free version said to be limited in customization.

Therefore, the external css sheet is used as a work around to override the primary color in MDB including default (blue) input field focus border color.
